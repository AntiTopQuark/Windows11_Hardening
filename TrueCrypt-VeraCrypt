With SecureBoot, Windows can verify that the OS hasn't been compromised by scanning for bootkits before the computer boots. This validity is achieved through a secure chain of trust from the BIOS to BitLocker. 
This functionality is critical for preventing an entire category of attacks against Windows. These attacks are not theoretical.

3rd party encryption tools such as VeraCrypt for OS FDE break this chain of trust.
Regarding encrypted containers, Windows can also do this natively with the EFS feature.
