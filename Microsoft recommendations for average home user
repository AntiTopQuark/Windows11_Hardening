Microsoft recommendations for the average home user follow directly from Windows built-in (mostly default) settings:

1.  Use the updated Windows 10 and well updated software.
2.  Use Microsoft Defender or another good AV.
3.  Use Microsoft account.
4.  Use Edge web browser with SmartScreen and PUA protection enabled - do not ignore/bypass the security alerts.
5.  Do not use too many web browser extensions and install only extensions from trusted vendors.
6.  Use Edge as a PDF viewer.
7.  Use Windows Mail app as a mail client.
8.  Use free versions of MS Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) already available in Windows. They work in Edge web browser and do not allow active content in documents.
9.  Backup your personal files.

For above-average users:  
-   Prepare for children and inexperienced family members the Standard User Accounts, if you understand how SUA works (especially when installing the software with Admin rights).
-   Avoid installing 3rd party real-time security (one is usually enough).
-   Prefer installing popular & digitally signed applications.
-   Use Windows built-in tools to clean up the system. Do not try to make enhanced clean-up with 3rd-party tools, because you will not see a difference and these tools can cause hidden problems.
-   Do not be paranoid about Microsoft telemetry.
-   **If you change the default Windows setup, try to make it as secure as before.**

The last point (marked with asterisk) is very important. For example, changing Edge to Chrome web browser requires installing some extensions. Using another email-client requires attention, because 3-rd party email-clients do not run in AppContainer and allow running unsafe attachments. Using a 3-rd party unpacker (like 7-Zip) is usually not fully compatible with SmartScreen (the file MOTW is lost), etc.
