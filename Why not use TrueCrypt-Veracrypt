With SecureBoot, before your computer boots to Windows it verifies the OS hasn't been corrupted with a bootkit that modifies Windows that lets a virus run hidden.
3rd party encryption tools break this chain of trust that flows from UEFI to Windows bootloader to BitLocker.
This chain of trust is critical for preventing an entire category of attack against Windows.
This is not theoretical, this stops real-life attacks.
