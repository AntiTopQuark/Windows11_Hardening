On standard Windows settings, Malware can hide itself if the filename is like:
Secure-File.txt.exe

What you see? A file named
Secure-File.txt

Of course the attacker can add a differend icon to the file, so it looks like you open the file type extension you think.
And if you open it, the Malware start's. See Crypto trojans

In Registry (regedit.exe) editor go to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
and change the string
HideFileExt
to
00000000

Finish. No restart required.
You can config this in Windows explorer settings (GUI) too.
